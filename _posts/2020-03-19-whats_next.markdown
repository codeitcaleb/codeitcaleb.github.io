I write this after just passing my Final Project Assessment and I honestly don't know how to feel right. This has been a long journey but I wouldn't have had it any other way. I've learned so much during my time here and have truly fallen in love with coding. As I look to begin my job search and finally get into my career as software engineer a few thngs stand out in particular as to what I want to do as a developer. So what's next for "CODE-IT CALEB"?

## Goal #1: Start My Career as a Software Engineer
My goal through this entire process has been to be able to contribute to a platform that I have always been interested in: mobile technology. I want to be a Mobile App Developer who specializes in React Native and iOS Development.

## Goal #2: Continue Learning
As a developer, the technologies in this industry are forever changing. It's hard to get used to anything and as I've gone through this program, I've grown to embrace this change. I want to broaden my knowledge on the fundamentals and cement this knowledge as I continue on throughout my career. So as I continue on this journey a few languages and frameworks/libraries that I want to learn or gain mastery in are:

*  JavaScript- 

* React/React Native-

* Ruby on Rails-

* Express/NodeJS-

* Swift

## Goal #3: Give Back
One of the goals that I've had since the beginning of my journey, one of my goals has been to start a non-profit dedicated to teaching kids with Sickle Cell Anemia how to code. This has been a cose that has been very important to me because I myself grew up with this genetic blood disorder. People with this disease often find themselves in and out of the hospital and I want to provide them with a skillset that they could potentially use to help take care off themselves. I've personally found that even if I had to be hospitalized and long as I had my MacBook, that I could still work and be able to code from anywhere even, from a hospital.
