I know what you're thinking... Another, Pokedex CLI but this was such a fun yet frustrating project and I feel like this was the best choice for me. I learned so much and was challenged and pushed to my limit and I was so close to giving up but I broke through my limits.

Me being a longtime anime and video game fan, Pokemon was probably one of the biggest parts of my childhood and was one of the video games I ever played all the way back on the GameBoy Color so it was fitting to do a project based on it. Even as I was struggling through learning Object Oriented Relationships in Ruby, it was an article that related back to Pokemon that made everything click for me.

I didn't want to just do any old pokedex though and at the very least I wanted to express my creativity through my project. After a little brainstorming I decided to do model my CLI Pokedex after a scene in the most recent season of the anime, the Rotomdex. My goal was to create a CLI version of the this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40gHu_-eZI

The process of scraping the website wasn't overly difficult once you understand the process. I looked over a few different pokedex websites but the one that I ended up using was the https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/national. I wanted to scrape the entire website and grab all 809 Pokemon which in itself was one of the biggest chalenges. At first ended up making a method for that took the ranges of all of the Pokemon from all 7 generations and at first I thought that would work for me, that is until the last open office hours of our project week. One of the instructors in my cohort basically broke down  what I was doing with several methods that broke each generation down into the Pokemon in each version and structuring that into a case statement, she essentialy showed me that what I was doing could be done in essentially 3 lines of code. I was amazed and lost at the same time and all of a sudden felt like I was back at square one.

I got to a point where I felt like I had forgotten everything that I had learned. It was a lot and I felt like I didn’t know enough. Eventhough it, had barely been a month since I had started the program and I had already started questioning if I could really do this. I know I’m not the only one who feels that way. Imposter Syndrome is real and it sucks but this is what I want to do. It isn’t easy but I’ve come to enjoy it and don’t want to give it up. Nothing’s ever been a challenge to me because I’ve always learned things without any issue or need to study. Programming is different, it challenges me and forces me to think things through and I love that. 

After attending all of the open office hours and countless hours spent on coding, I finally got my program to work the way I had wanted to, almost... I had wanted to give the user the option to choose a Pokemon by name, number or generation but in the end I could only able to complete the generation portion of the project. It's still a pretty robust little CLi and overall I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. That feeling alone was priceless to me because I proved to myself that I could do this. 

Looking back on this experience I believe it only helps me bbecome a better and more efficient programmer and I am really thankful for that learning experience. Being able to create something and see yourself imrove is definitely something to be proud of and with every line of code and new experience I see myself growing into the software engineer that I know I can be.
