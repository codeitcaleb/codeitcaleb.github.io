*TL;DR: This will be elaborated on further in a mini-series of posts that go into more detail on how to work with Ruby on Rails as an API so stay tuned. *

Like it's predecessor, this project in itself was a learning experience. Ruby on Rails as a whole is a very fun to work with framework. This being my first time working with Rails in API mode was pretty straightforward and easy to work with. Of course, with this still being a new experience for me it was still relatively easy to get going once you understand how Rails works fundamentally. 

Originally I had wanted to do a different project from any of my previous ones but after looking into what was required, my first choice had to be placed on hold as what was validations wasn't a requirement but needed in the direction that I was looking to go in. This made me re-think what I wanted to do. If you have been following my journey and my previous projects, you would know that I've had ideas for all of my projects figured out: with the only thing missing being the knowledge to execute them. 

When I first came into this program I couldn't wait to get to the JavaScript module of the curriculum as I had wanted to focus on Front End Web Development as my concentration and now that I am here, I have realized that there is so much more to coding the just what you see and I have developed an not just an appreciation for the Back End but a curiousity to continue learning more about it as well. 

As I've gone through this process I've discovered the beauty of Ruby and the framework known as Ruby on Rails. There is so much that you can do with it and after realizing that I wanted to dive deeper and learn more about Rails. I will be writing a series of blog posts as I continue to learn that will cover topics in Ruby on Rails such as:

* Active Storage
* Action Cable
* Rails as an API
* React on Rails

This project and my experience as a whole has inspired me to dive deeper into everything that can be done with Ruby on Rails as a whole and as I conclude my time at Flatiron School, I will continue my learning with Ruby on Rails while also pursuing my love of coding.
